# Links Related to S4TF

The new activity around Swift for TensorFlow touches on several disparate topics. Subprojects involve everything from bypassing Apple's iOS sandbox to making OpenCL kernels for machine learning. As time progresses, the project continues growing larger. Here is an official list of repositories created for the purpose of resurrecting S4TF:

- [github.com/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf) - The [S4TF Organization](https://github.com/philipturner/s4tf) hosts inactive S4TF repositories formerly hosted by Google. Anyone is free to become a member, even if just symbolically.
- [s4tf/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf/s4tf) - The new head repository of S4TF. This is a fork of [tensorflow/swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis).
