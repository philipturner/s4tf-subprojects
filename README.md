# Links Related to S4TF

The new activity around Swift for TensorFlow touches on several disparate topics. Subprojects involve everything from bypassing Apple's iOS sandbox to making OpenCL kernels for machine learning. Here is an growing list of code created for the purpose of resurrecting S4TF:

- [s4tf/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf/s4tf) - The new head repository of S4TF. This is a fork of [tensorflow/swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis). In the future, I plan to merge the awesome-looking README of [s4tf-docs](https://github.com/s4tf-docs) into this repo.
- [s4tf-build-script](https://gist.github.com/philipturner/7aa063af04277d463c14168275878511) - Thanks to [s4tf-docker](https://gitlab.com/swift4science/s4tf-docker/-/tree/main), we know how to compile S4TF again. This gist could be unmaintained in the future, if the build script becomes embedded in official documentation.
