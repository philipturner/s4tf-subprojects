# Links/Roadmap of the New S4TF

The new activity around Swift for TensorFlow touches on several disparate topics. Subprojects involve everything from bypassing Apple's iOS sandbox to making OpenCL kernels for machine learning. Here is an growing list of code created for the purpose of resurrecting S4TF:

- [s4tf/s4tf](https://github.com/s4tf/s4tf) - The new head repository of S4TF. This is a fork of [tensorflow/swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis). In the future, I plan to merge the awesome-looking README of [s4tf-docs](https://github.com/s4tf-docs) into this repo.
- [swift4science/s4tf-docker](https://gitlab.com/swift4science/s4tf-docker) - Thanks to this repo, we know how to compile S4TF again. The work is incorporated into the [S4TF build script](https://gist.github.com/philipturner/7aa063af04277d463c14168275878511), currently hosted as a GitHub gist. That script will eventually be embedded in S4TF documentation.

- philipturner/swift-colab
- philipturner/swift-reflection-mirror
- philipturner/swift-opencl

The [s4tf](https://github.com/philipturner/s4tf) organization hosts inactive repositories formerly hosted by the [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) organization. Anyone is free to become a member, even if just symbolically. To request to join, contact me over GitHub or email.
